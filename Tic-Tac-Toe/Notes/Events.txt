A event in SDL is anything that is going on in the window created by SDL(depending on the type of event).

SDL_Event is a structure the can store all the type of events (one at a time). We can also initialize
event by directly using the event structure ( Eg. SDL_MouseMotionEvent is a structure ), the is present
by the name of motion in SDL_Event structure.
